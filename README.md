#### goals
are among other things also
- [fast] find (strings and groups) inside the L* 2.x (µ+) installation, also e.g. image-descriptions, page-keywords
- flex output for the search-results (e.g. via TWIG-(frontend-)template ans/or additional modules (pipe-processing).
- flex handling for the regExpr inside (e.g. via “suites” or “sub-plugins”)
